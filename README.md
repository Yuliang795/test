## CPEVAL Benchmark

### ðŸ“‚Dataset
Each entry in the dataset JSON file corresponds to a problem instance, keyed by a **problem ID** as in CSPLib.

Each problem is represented as a dictionary with the following fields:
* **`source`**: Origin of the problem (e.g., `"csplib"`).
* **`name`**: Name of the problem.
* **`content`**: Problem description.
* **`value_info`**: Specification of the input parameters, including their meaning, type, and structure.
* **`ref_sol_format`**: Specification of the expected output solution format, including variable names, types, sizes, and optionaly examples.
* **`prob_type`**: `"cop"` (constraint optimization problem) or `"csp"` (constraint satisfaction problem).
